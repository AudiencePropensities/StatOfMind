This repository includes files and scripts that I have found useful to analyze data. I make frequent use of these scripts in the posts featured on my blog: http://statofmind.wordpress.com/

The title of the directories are self-explanatory and relate to a particular post I have featured on my blog. Each directory contains code and figures featured in the given post, as well as a README file.
